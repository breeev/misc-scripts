# misc-scripts
Personal startup scripts for Linux.

`fortune-refresh`: change the `fish` console greeting message with a new `fortune`; obvious deps = `fish` and `fortune-mod` / `fortune`.  
`pdf2png.py`: converts PDFs to PNGs (with a simple prompt); needs the `pdf2image` Python lib.  
`xinp.py`: my favorite, turns any mouse currently connected (and detected with 'mouse' in its title) into a scrolling god (auto-scroll like on Firefox or Chrome, scrolls while the middle-button is pressed); needs `xinput` and `libinput`.
